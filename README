This is a simulator of the Monty Hall Problem I made to demonstrate it to my girlfriend.
It's a logic problem I've always found particularly interesting,
and it's fun to see it run a few thousand times to get hard numbers on it.
game_many.py is the "fun" one, walking you through the problem,
and keeping statistics on your past games. It's all in command line.
As you play through enough games, the statistics should suggest
that switching doors leads to a win twice as often as staying.

game_auto.py does all the playing for you. You type in a number
of games you want to simulate, and it will run through them,
randomly deciding to stay or switch, and then produce the results.
For large enough numbers (~10,000), you will almost certainly
see that switching wins 66% to staying's 33%.

Have fun!
